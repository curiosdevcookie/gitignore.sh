# gitignore.sh
For whenever you have committed files that you actually want to ignore from now on and want them removed from your repo, this little Shell Script is here for you ðŸ™‚

On your local machine, open your terminal and then copy and paste the following as a whole:

```
# 1.
# Remove unwanted files from the repository:
# rm means remove, -r means recursive, --cached means from cache, . means all files:
git rm -r --cached .

# 2.
# Add all files again that you want to keep (=everything except the .gitignore file):
git add .

# 3.
# Then commit:
git commit -m "Remove directories and files as listed in .gitignore"

# 4. Push the changes to the remote repository:
git push

# 5. Have a good day!
```
